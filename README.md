# MSAzureOnboardingOffboarding
_Automated Onboarding and Offboarding for Users in Entra ID._
This project focuses on employee onboarding and offboarding in an organisation that uses Microsoft Entra ID and Azure services. The main features for this project is combining an HR Sharepoint form with Azure Logic Apps and Azure Automation Runbooks to onboard or offboard users at a specific date and time as created in the HR SharePoint form. I am constantly working on making improvements to the amount of automated scripts in the Runbook allowing more features. All powershell commands are using the Microsoft Graph modules and no longer using depreciated azure/AZ modules.
